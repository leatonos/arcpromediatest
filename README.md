# Arc Pro test for Pedro Baptista

## Introduction

This project is a test made for ArcPro Media to test me, Pedro Baptista. Due to time constraints, I opted to utilize Bootstrap 5 to expedite the development process and ensure a responsive design at maximum speed.

## Why Bootstrap 5?

### Ease of Responsiveness
Bootstrap 5's responsive grid system makes it incredibly easy to create layouts that adapt seamlessly to various screen sizes. With just a few classes, I was able to ensure that my website looks great on desktops, tablets, and smartphones without the need for extensive CSS tweaking.

### Fast Development
Given the time constraints of this project (only 24 hours), Bootstrap 5's extensive library of pre-designed components and utilities proved invaluable. I could quickly prototype and build out the website's UI using ready-made elements such as buttons, forms, navigation bars, and cards. This allowed me to focus more on the functionality and layout of the site rather than spending time on styling from scratch and creating multiple media queries

### Pre-made JavaScript Interactions
Bootstrap 5 includes JavaScript plugins for common UI interactions such as modals, navbars, tooltips, and carousels. These pre-made components saved me additional time and effort, as I could easily incorporate interactive elements into my website without having to write custom JavaScript code.

## Conclusion

This was a project that tested my skills of choosing what to sacrifice or not when I have limited time for a project. If I had more time, I would have created client interactions with javascript or even typescript, animations and database interactions with php, mySQL or any other backend technology. But I believe that I fullfilled the task with all the requirements, it is simple but is serves its purpose.
